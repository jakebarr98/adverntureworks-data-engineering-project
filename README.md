# adverntureworks-data-engineering-project

This project is a basic beginners project to help me understand the fundamentals of data engineering using the microsoft stack of Azure.

My dataset for this project is the Adventureworks database from Microsoft, which I had restored in SSMS

Within Azure I created the following resources:
  Resource Group
    Subscription
    Key Vault
    Data Factory
    Databricks
    Storage Account (Data Lake)
